With a subscription-based model, there is an avenue for the .bit ecosystem to generate revenue, and provide incentives for the development teams to continuously improve the system, and attract new developers to maintain the system.

What is the principle of anti-squatting?</h3><p>On the blockchain, all operations from a user are public and transparent. Therefore, this potentially presents an issue: when a user wants to register for a certain .bit account and the corresponding transaction is still in the memory pool and not packed into the block, the public can see the name of the account that this user wants to register for. The public can take advantage of this and hijack the intended user&#39;s request by immediately issuing a transaction with a higher gas fee to incentivise miners to package his/her transaction first, buying the user&#39;s intended .bit account. He/she can then sell the account at a higher price to the original user who wants to own it.</p><p>To prevent squatting behaviors, the .bit contract requires a two-step process, corresponding to two transactions, for registering a new account:</p><ol><li><strong>Apply for registration in private</strong>: Hash the account to be registered with the registrant&#39;s public key, send the first transaction, and place this hash on the blockchain</li><li><strong>Reveal the account name on the chain</strong>: Initiate a registration request, exposing the account name to be registered and carrying the hash from the previous step, while the contract requires the hash to reach a mature state, i.e. the last transaction has been packed into the block and reached a certain number of confirmations.</li></ol><p>The two transactions need to be spaced-out, and the second transaction needs to include the Cell created by the first transaction. In addition, the user only discloses the plaintext of the account they want to register in the second step. By the time a malicious Keeper or miner sees the plaintext, it would be too late. He/she has to start with the first transaction, and by the time he or she is ready, other Keepers would have already registered the account for the user.</p><h3 id="why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-does-the-interface-show-that-i-have-finished-the-anti-squatting-step-but-the-bit-account-i-want-to-register-is-taken-by-someone-else" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why does the interface show that I have finished the anti-squatting step but the .bit account I want to register is taken by someone else?</h3><p>This could happen when you and someone else is trying to register the same .bit account at the same time. Anti-squatting can only prevent malicious squatting when someone gets the account you want to register by watching the blockchain. It does not prevent all parties from spontaneously registering an account at the same time.</p><h3 id="will-the-paid-fee-for-failed-registrations-be-refunded" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#will-the-paid-fee-for-failed-registrations-be-refunded" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Will the paid fee for failed registrations be refunded?</h3><p>Yes, fees will be refunded.
